          <p>
            Palestine is a small region of land that has played a prominent role in the ancient and modern history of the Middle East.
            <br><br>The history of Palestine has been marked by frequent political conflict and violent land seizures because of its importance to several major world religions, and because Palestine sits at a valuable geographic crossroads between Africa and Asia.
            <br><br>Today, Arab people who call this territory home are known as Palestinians, and the people of Palestine have a strong desire to create a free and independent state in this contested region of the world.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>ISRAELI-PALESTINE CONFLICT</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict began with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.
            <br><br>This conflict came from the intercommunal violence in Mandatory Palestine between Israelis and Arabs from 1920 and erupted into full-scale hostilities in the 1947–48 civil war. <br>The conflict continues to the present day on various levels.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>THE SIMPLIFIED REALITY</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The Arab Muslims, Arab Christians, and Arab jews lived in harmony for many years, especially in Jerusalem.
            <br>
            The three abrahamic religions share many historic landmarks; even places of worship side by side demonstrating strong unity support, and respect amongst the groups.
            <br><br>
          After the holocaust, as the antisemitism grew in Europe, many Jews were kicked out making them refugees.
          Palestine took in most of the Jewish refugees.
          <br><br>
          However, as antisemitism got worse in Europe, the Zoinist movement bagan in the 19th century; an idealogy that wanted a Jewish only state.
          <br><br>
          To get rid of all the Jews from Europe - Britain stepped in and decided to give away Palestinian land to the European Jews without consulting with the United Nations, surrounding Arab countries, and Palestine themselves.
          <br><br>
          Eventually, temporary peace was made and land was divided.
          <br>
          However, the Zionists wanted more.
          <br><br>
          Britain and the UN stepped in once again and split the land to each group - howver the Zoinist land ended up getting all the agriculture, technology, transport, resources, etc. Whereas the Palestinians were left with nothing.
          <br><br>
          This soon got worse as Palestinians were denied resources andt their homes were illegally occupied and movement were restricted.
          <br><br>
          In 1948, David Ben-Gurion, then head of the World Zionist Organisation, announced the founding of the state of Israel in Palestine.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>THE BALFOUR DECLARATION</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>On November 2, 1917, the British foreign secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour, permanently changed the political and geographic landscape of the Middle East.<br><br>Outlining British support for the establishment of a Jewish state, it set in motion a series of events that culminated in the declaration of the previously been Palestine land - and the West Bank and Gaza strip.
            <br><br>Ultimately, the declaration promised a state to the Jews despite Palestinian natives comprimising some 90% of the population. In the words of Palestinian scholar Edward Said, this was a declaration "made by a European power ... about a non-European territory .. in a flat disregard of both the presence and wishes of the native majority resident in that territory". It's ramifications are still felt today.</p>
